# Next.js Blog

Hi all! This is the project files for my blog, built using Next.js, MySql and Auth.js. The blog features a very lite CMS that I made for basic CRUD operations.

## What's Next?

I plan to continously develop this application in parralel to me actually using this blog. I hope for this to be a benefical learning experience for me. Once I've got the blog up and running in a VPS, I'll add the link here.
